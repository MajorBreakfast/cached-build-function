# Excel File Reading Example

- `npm install`
- `npm run build`
- The `cache/` folder will contain some cache entries

Take a look at [build.js](https://github.com/MajorBreakfast/cached-build-function/blob/master/example/excel-file-reading/build.js) to see the code.

*Note: This example uses a small excel file. `CachedBuildFunction` makes most sense for really large excel files.*
